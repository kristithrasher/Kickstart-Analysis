# kickstart-analysis
## Overview of the Project
Louise is a client. She is a playwright who wants to launch a fundraising campaign for her next play titled FEVER. She has a budget of little over $10,000.00.  She would like for us to help her have a successful campaign. We analyzed a set of data provided to us with information regarding to similar fundraising campaigns to see if we could help Louise make her campaign a success. 
### Purpose
Purpose of this project it to analyze data gathered and to determine if we can help Louise achieve a successful outcome based on her budget. 
## Analysis and Challenges
When analyzing the data some of the challenges I encountered was the Data set included some data that wasn’t needed such as ““blurbs”) to get what was required for this particular project. Also, some conversions needed to be made to make it readable to the average person. I focused on Category and Subcategory Theater/Plays and Goal amount for successful and failed outcomes on a campaign project. This particular data helped me narrow down what I needed in order to help put it in similar project campaign as Louise. 
I also wanted to narrow it down by analyzing the Outcome success based on Launch dates. This involved using a date conversion function to make It readable. Had to also filter the outcome data by only looking at Successful and Failed. Live really wasn’t relevant due to not having an end outcome yet and canceled fell into the failed outcome. Redundant data if you will. 
I performed my analysis by organizing specific data into separate tables, creating charts and tables to help narrow down data that was relevant to give me a visual way of looking at the data and being able to filter that data by relevance such as subcategory “PLAYS”. 
I would also create visual charts to display the data and it would help me gather more detail by using specific formulas to make some calculations. I did encounter some issues when creating charts due to my main data sheet being in filter or sort mode and so I would need to clear that when appropriate so it would capture all my data. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I analyzed this data by creating a pivot table from my main dataset (Kickstart). With the pivot table I focused on Theater and Years. We did not have a year’s column of data set and used the function to extract the year from Date Created column.  This narrowed it down from a long date to just the year the campaign was created. I then set up my pivot table to gather the data I wanted such as Parent Category, Years and Outcomes. I ran into the Years had some options, so I specifically chose Month in the pivot TABLE. Using the pivot table I created a line chart that showed me visually the Theatre Outcome status Based on Launch Date (Date Created).  
-Two conclusions about the Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
    1.The Theater Category had doubled successful outcomes in comparison to failed outcomes.
        May is a good time to campaign. 
    2.There was a decrease in Failed outcomes and slight increase in Successful outcomes in month of October just to make December Successful and Failed were both the same at about 50%. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Looking at the percentage of outcomes (Successful, Failed, and Canceled) plays based on the funding goal amount. We created a new table with the Goal data range and the number of Outcomes and Percentage of Outcomes. This is found on a separate sheet titled "Outcomes Vs Goals"
The chart was used for making calculations. We used the different functions to helps us separate the data within the Goal Column of main Dataset(Kickstart). We then created a line chart titled OUtcomes_Vs_Goals. 
-Conclusion based on the Outcomes based on Goal was that the most successful outcome on a play project campaign was when the goal amount was in the range of $35,000 to $44,999. I believe Louise will need to add to her budget or have fundraising meet the goal range of $35k to 45k. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I had trouble with my hardware and update versions on some excel functions but went back to my previous version and was fine. I also encountered data that was calculated incorrectly due to filters being applied to my data table. I fixed this by clearing all filters before creating the chart or table for that data.  

## Result
-Two conclusions about the  Based on Launch Date are
   1.The Theater Category had doubled successful outcomes in comparison to failed outcomes.
        May is a good time to campaign. 
    2.There was a decrese in Failed outcomes and slight increase in Successful outcomes in month of October just to make December Successful and Failed were both the same at about 50%. 

- I Conclusion based on the Outcomes based on Goal was that the most successful outcome on a play project campaign was when the goal amount was in the range of $35,000 to $44,999. 

-Limitations of this dataset are...too much unneeded data, some conversions need to be made on some of the data to make it readable. Needed to add some data to original data.
the Outcomes Based on Goal chart shows the successful GOal ranges. Also included below is a chart that shows which months are most successful for a Theatre production. 

-Some other possible tables and bar graphs that you could create would be maybe a pie chart or other graphs with statistical data shown.
