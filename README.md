## Overview of the Project
Louise is a client. She is a playwright who wants to launch a fundraising campaign for her next play titled FEVER. She has a budget of little over $10,000.00.  
###Purpose
Purpose of this project it to analyze data gathered and to determine if we can help Louise achieve a successful outcome based on her budget. 
## Analysis and Challenges
When analyizing the data some of the challenges I encountered was the Data set included data we really didn't need to get what we were wanting to look at. Also some conversions needed to be made to make it readable to the average person. I wanted to narrow my analysis down to Theater/Plays and Goal amount for successful and failed outcomes on a project. I also wanted to narrow it down by analyzing the OUtcome success based on Launch dates.  I had to use the YEAR function to pull the year from Date created.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
## Result
-Two conclusions about the  Based on Launch Date are
    1.The Theater Category was most sucessful which is good becuase Plays fall under this category. 
    2.

-Conclusion based on the Outcomes based on Goal was that the most successful outcome on a play project campaign was when the goal amount was in the range of $35,000 to $39,999. 


-Some of the limitations of this dataset are...too much unneeded data, some conversions need to be made on some of the data to make it readable. Needed to add some data to original data. 

-Some other possible tables and bar graphs that you could create would be a bar graph on percentage of outcomes based on Goal Range.
